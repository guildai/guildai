  description: Example using explicit output-scalars

  # Output scalars can be explicitly defined as map of scalar key to
  # pattern. Use a group in the pattern to capture the scalar value.
  # The special key `step` is used to set the global step that is
  # applied to logged scalars.

  output-scalars:
    step: 'step: (\value)'
    loss: 'loss: (\value)'
    accuracy: 'accuracy: (\value)'

  description: Example using a generalized scalar pattern

  main: train

  # Specify a pattern with two groups. Guild uses the first group as
  # key and the second as value. Values must be parseable as numbers.
  # Guild supports special escape values \key and \value to specify
  # regex patterns for keys and values respectively. (Note that you
  # can change the order of the groups to make keys second by using
  # named groups 'key' and 'value'. This is an unusual case however
  # and not illustrated here).

  output-scalars: '^(\key): (\value)'

  description: Example disabling output scalars and using TF event files
  main: train_with_tensorboardX

  # This example disables output scalars altogether. Note that the
  # training script uses tensorboardX to log scalars directly. In this
  # case there's no need for Guild to look at script output at all.

  output-scalars: no
