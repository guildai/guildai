  requires:

    # Operation requires a run from prepare-data. By default, Guild
    # selects the latest non-error run of the specified operation. If
    # a prepare-data run is marked (i.e. using `guild mark ...`) it
    # will be used instead.

    - operation: prepare-data

      # The `path` attribute is used to store selected files in a path
      # under the run directory. This is useful for strucuting the run
      # directory - especially if the train operation expects files in
      # a specific location.

      path: data

      # Name must be defined to let users specify specific runs to be
      # used for the required operation. E.g. here we define the name
      # as `prepared-data` so that the user can specify a specific run
      # using `guild run prepared-data=RUN-ID`. (Future releases of
      # Guild will use the operation name by default - in the
      # meantime, this attribute is required to let users specify a
      # run explicitly.)

train2:
  description: Alternative train using different data structure
  main: train2
  requires:

    # This is a similar requirement to that of `train` above, but
    # structures the prepare-data output differently. Specifically, it
    # selects a single file from the two that are generated and stores
    # it directly in the train run directory (rather than a `data`
    # subdirectory as above).

    - operation: prepare-data

      # A `select` attribute may be used to select specific files from
      # the prepare-data file. In this case, `data2.txt` will be
      # selected and included in the train run directory. Note there
      # is no `path` attribute, so the selected files will be linked
      # in the run directory root.

      select:
        - subdir/data2.txt

      # Selected files can be renamed using `PATTERN REPLACE` where
      # `PATTERN` is a regular expression to match and `REPLACE` is
      # the replacement.

      rename: data2 data

      # As with the previous requires example, we use a name to let
      # users specify alternative prepare-data runs.

      name: prepared-data
