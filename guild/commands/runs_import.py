    `ARCHIVE` must be a directory that contains exported runs. Archive

    You may use ``guild runs list --archive ARCHIVE`` to view runs in
    `ARCHIVE`.

    By default, resources are NOT copied with each imported run, but
    their links are maintained. To copy resources, use
    `--copy-resources`.

    **WARNING**: Use `--copy-resources` with care as each imported run
    will contain a separate copy of each resource!
