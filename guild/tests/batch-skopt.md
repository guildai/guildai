# Batch runs - skopt

These tests run each of the skopt based optimizers:

    - gp
    - forest
    - gbrt

We'll use the `noisy.py` script in the `optimizers` sample project.

    >>> project = Project(sample("projects", "optimizers"))

A helper to run an optimizer batch:

    >>> def run(optimizer, x, trials, opt_flags=None):
    ...    return project.run(
    ...        "noisy.py",
    ...        flags={"x": x},
    ...        opt_flags=opt_flags,
    ...        optimizer=optimizer,
    ...        max_trials=trials,
    ...        simplify_trial_output=True)
