# Run ops

When an operation is run, the module `guild.commands.run_impl`
resolves the command line specification to an instance of
`guild.operation.Op`, which is used to both preview the operation and
also to run the operation.

These tests look at this behavior by running various module functions.

    >>> from guild.commands import run_impl

For the tests below, we'll call `run_impl._resolve_model_op` with
various combinations of parsed arguments within a temp working
directory to control what the run command sees.

Here's the working directory:

And the helper function:

    >>> def resolve_model_op(opspec, cwd):
    ...     with Chdir(cwd):
    ...         from guild import op_util
    ...         return op_util.opdef_for_opspec(opspec)

## Bad op specs

The tests below illustrate various invalid operation specs.

To control our test context, we'll use a new directory.

    >>> cwd = mkdtemp()

Running a non-existing operation with no model spec:

    >>> resolve_model_op("train", cwd) # doctest: -NORMALIZE_PATHS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    NoSuchModel: train

Running a non-existing operation with a model spec:

    >>> resolve_model_op("model:train", cwd) # doctest: -NORMALIZE_PATHS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    NoSuchModel: model:train

## Op for a Python script

Let's create an empty Python script in the working directory and
specify it as the op spec.

    >>> write(join_path(cwd, "train.py"), "")

We'll resolve the operation, capturing any warnings:

    >>> from logging import WARN
    >>> with LogCapture(log_level=WARN) as log:
    ...     opdef = resolve_model_op("train.py", cwd)
    >>> opdef.opref
    OpRef(pkg_type='script',
          pkg_name='...',
          pkg_version='',
          model_name='',
          op_name='train.py')

Ignore any warnings:

    >>> logs = log.get_all()
    >>> assert (not logs or
    ...         len(logs) == 1 and
    ...         logs[0].getMessage().startswith(
    ...            "cannot import flags from train.py")), logs

## Op for a shell script

Here's a shell script:

    >>> train_sh = join_path(cwd, "train.sh")
    >>> write(train_sh, "")

And the files in cwd:

    >>> find(cwd)
    train.py
    train.sh

The resolved model before making the script to executable (skipped on
Windows because exe permission isn't supported):

    >>> resolve_model_op("train.sh", cwd) # doctest: -WINDOWS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ModelOpProxyError: ('train.sh', 'must be an executable file')

Let's make the script executable:

    >>> import stat
    >>> os.chmod(train_sh, os.stat(train_sh).st_mode | stat.S_IEXEC)

And resolve again:

    >>> opdef = resolve_model_op("train.sh", cwd)
    >>> opdef.opref
    OpRef(pkg_type='script',
          pkg_name='...',
          pkg_version='',
          model_name='',
          op_name='train.sh')

## Op for batch spec

The special characeter '+' indicates that the operation should be a
batch run.

    >>> resolve_model_op("+", cwd)
    <guild.guildfile.OpDef '+'>
