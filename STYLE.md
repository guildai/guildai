# Guild AI Style Guide

Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) unless
otherwise noted.

## Classes

The Guild codebase attempts to minimize class use in Python. In many
cases, this is not practical and there are many uses of classes
throughout. Nonetheless, if something can be accomplished using
builtin Python types and functions, we should use those instead of
classes.

Extendable interfaces should be implemented using classes. Even when
duck-typing, a class should define the expected interface.

Avoid inheritance whenever possible.

Do not use multiple inheritance.

### Class implementation (experimental)

The codebase uses two distinct patterns for class implementation:

    - Instance and static methods
    - External functions

Example of instance and static method use:

``` python
class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, args):
        self.a = self._init_a(args)

    def _init_a(self, args):
        return self._a_from_args(args)

    @staticmethod
    def _a_from_args(args):
        return args.a
```

Pros:

- All Foo related code is associated with the Foo class
  - Easy to locate functions
  - Easy to remote functions related to Foo

Cons:

- Required use of `self` to call functions - this exposes object state
  when it's not otherwise needed

- Temptation to use order-dependent calls with side-effects to object
  state (this is an unfortunately used pattern in codebase)

- Required use of awkward `staticmethod` decorators

Example of external functions:

``` python
class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, args):
        self.a = _foo_init_a(args)


def _foo_init_a(args):
    return _a_from_args(args)


def _a_from_args(args):
    return args.a
```

Alternatively:

``` python
class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, args):
        _Foo_init(self, args)


def _Foo_init(foo, args):
    foo.a = _a_from_args(args)


def _a_from_args(args):
    return args.a
```

Pros:

- Natural use of functions
- Classes remain purely state and user-interface concerns

Cons:

- Requires some discipline to use this pattern and follow conventions
  (see below)
- Not strictly un-Pythonic but this is not a typical Python
  programming convention

**Conventions - Pattern 1**

1. Class methods are strictly used to:
   - Update state
   - Pass through a non-mutating call to a normal function
2. Use `_class_function_name` convention for normal functions that are
   tightly coupled to a class

**Conventions - Pattern 2**

1. Class methods are strictly used:
   - Pass through to a normal function
2. Use `_Class_function_name` naming convention for class-related
   functions
3. Position the object argument to class functions as the first
   argument

**General conventions**

1. Avoid functions that both modify an object and return a value -
   i.e. functions should be either read or write and not both

### Class implementation alt - no methods

Another approach is to use classes *strictly for state*. All functions
applicable to an object must be defined in normal functions.

The example above becomes:

``` python
class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a


def init_foo(args):
    return Foo(_foo_init_a(args))


def _foo_init_a(args):
    return args.a
```

Pros:

- Trivial pattern to implement

Cons:

- Does not support extensible frameworks in a Pythonic way

Regarding frameworks, if this pattern is used, we're talking this
convention:

    FRAMEWORK_NAMESPACE.function(COMMON_STATE_FORMAT)

vs:

    OBJECT.function()

While this is perfectly ordinary in many languages (C, Erlang, etc.)
it's *weird* in Python.

That said, we could fall back on the proposal above for frameworks,
where methods were pass-throughs to normal functions.

**UPDATE:** This is a solid pattern that we've started using in op2. It's
tempting to move init logic into a class constructor like this:

``` python
class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, args):
        self.a = _init_a(args)


def _init_a(args):
    return args.a
```

Instead, use this:

``` python
class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a


def _foo_init(args):
    return Foo(args.a)
```

The run is then simple: classes are **strictly** structs in Python.

There are some exceptions, which I think should be considered:

1. Object init is simple enough to perform in `__init__`. What
   constitutes "simple enough" is a judgment call.

2. Property methods can be used to implement reading of dynamic
   state. These should be rare.

**Rule of thumb:** Avoid the use of `self` except when assigning
`__init__` arguments to object attributes.

This is basically a named tuple. It raises the question, why not just
use named tuples?

## Anti-patterns

To be avoided *where it is reasonable to avoid*.

### Order-dependent object methods

Avoid:

``` python
class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.a = None

    def init_a(self, a):
        self.a = a

    def run(self):
        if self.a is None:
            raise RuntimeError("a must be set first - use init")
        print(self.a)
```

Instead:

``` python
class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a


def run_foo(foo):
    if foo.a is None:
        raise ValueError("foo.a cannot be None")
    print(foo.a)
```

## Naming conventions

### Factory functions - `for_xxx` and `yyy_for_xxx`

If a factory function return a module specific state type, they should
be named `for_xxx`, where `xxx` is the type of input to the function,

If they return a different state, they should be named `yyy_for_xxx`
where `yyy` is the state type.

Avoid `from_xxx`.

## Named tuples

Avoid using named tuples and instead use classes. As with other
classes (see above) they should not have methods.

Note that this convention conflicts with some integral structures in
Guild, not the least of which is OpRefs. It's not clear that moving
from this:

    run.opref.to_opspec()

to this:

    opreflib.to_opspec(run.opref)

provides any value. It may likely be that simple methods like this are
preferred to functions.
